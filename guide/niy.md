# ScoreMaster 4 - Features not implemented yet


Several features of v3 ScoreMaster are not implemented in this version. Such features might appear in future versions as and when they're needed. They're described here in anticipation of questions beginning "What happened to feature X?"

## Multiple Legs

It is possible to establish a rally with multiple distinct legs rather than the common arrangement of a single leg. A multi-leg rally has start and finish times for each leg, might be scored separately, and can have bonuses and/or combos restricted to a single leg.

It is obviously possible to run a multi-leg rally by establish multiple databases and swapping between legs.

## Entrant emailing

This feature is used to send customised emails to entrants, with or without small attachments, selected by entrant status and/or flag numbers. Typically used to distribute GPX files and/or Flag numbers at the rally start.

## Starting cohorts

Probably no longer needed. Was useful during Covid but starts now tend to be either a single mass start or with first claim starts.

## Odo check facility

No longer used cos, let's face it, a 20 mile check route really doesn't give anything like accuracy, even when the team remembers to include tenths in the trip reading.

## Double-claim rest bonuses

The rest bonus claim method of sending separate start and finish claims has proved open to failure by entrants and is to be replaced with single claim, double receipts, instead. ScoreMaster's claim matching facility will be continued but is not a priority.

## Limit number of claims

The facility to impose a limit on the number of claims available for scoring has never actually been used so is not currently a priority.

## ScoreMaster AI

A fully AI version of ScoreMaster may well appear by the 3rd quarter of 2026. This is an exciting prospect: ScoreMaster AI will be distinguished from regular ScoreMaster by the addition of "AI" after "ScoreMaster" on all screens and printouts. In all other respects, ScoreMaster AI will be exactly the same as regular ScoreMaster.


## Missed combo analysis

This is a niche requirement desired by rally teams with too much time on their hands - the ability to ask the question "why did this entrant not score this combo?" and receive a listing of "missed" or unclaimed bonuses resulting in failure to claim a combo.
