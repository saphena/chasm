# ScoreMaster v4 - Complex arithmetic

When applying complex rules to individual bonus scores (as opposed to a group score) the following is possible, starting with some definitions:-

- **BV** = points value of current bonus
- **RV** = the *results in* value of current rule
- **N** is the number of bonuses scored within the category
- **N1** is **N** - 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; *a convenient term*
- **SV** is the resulting score
