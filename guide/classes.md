# ScoreMaster v4 - Classes

In most rallies only one certificate class, Finisher, is used but it is also possible to use multiple classes with different certificates.

Such classes can be assigned manually or automatically. Manual classes might be used for example to distinguish between entrants riding BMWs and those riding Hondas. Automatic classes could be used for example to provide separate certificates for podium finishers.
