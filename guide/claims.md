# ScoreMaster 4 - Claims handling

Claims can be amended or deleted via [Show all claims]. All such activity results in scorecard recalculation for the entrant.

Claims can be decided (judged) in one of four ways:-

- Accept good claim
- Reject claim
- Exclude claim
- Leave undecided

As it suggests, *Accept good claim* awards the score for this claim.
Rejecting a claim, further refined into one of eight reasons, denies the score for this claim.
Excluding a claim, different from rejecting a claim, means that the claim does not affect scoring and will not appear on scorecards.
Leave undecided returns the claim to the bottom of the queue. "I'll look again later" or "I'll let Suzy decide this one".

Normally, claims will be either accepted or rejected. Excluding a claim should be a rare event, in response to special circumstances.
