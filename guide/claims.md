# ScoreMaster 4 - Claims handling

Claims are normally processed via [Judge incoming claims] but they can also be amended or deleted via [Show all claims]. All such activity results in scorecard recalculation for the entrant.

Claims can be decided (judged) in one of four ways:-

- Accept good claim
- Reject claim
- Exclude claim
- Leave undecided

**Leave undecided** returns the claim to the bottom of the queue. "*I'll look again later*" or "*I'll let Suzy decide this one*".


## Accept good claim

When a claim is accepted, it replaces (supersedes) any earlier claim for the same bonus, regardless of the status of the earlier claim. Superseded claims do not appear on scorecards, only the effective claim appears.

## Reject claim

When a claim is rejected, it replaces earlier claims as above. It appears on scorecards along with a reason for rejection: 'no photo', 'out of hours', etc.

## Exclude claim

When a claim is excluded, it has no effect on the score and will not appear on scorecards. Claim exclusion is and should be a very rare event. While this decision can be applied to any claim, it should only be used for claims which are "not scoreable". This might include claims for non-existent bonuses or claims beyond a rally maximum claims threshold. These might also be *rejected* in the normal way.
