# ScoreMaster v4

## Demonstration &amp; Training Guide

The purpose of this release is to provide a demonstration of the software, to act as a training facility for rally team members tasked with administering rallies or basic claim judging and, last but by no means least, to expose the software to more widespread testing.

## Explore!

This demo is disposable, you can't do any harm by experimenting with it. You can add and delete entrants and bonuses; you can vary the rally parameters; you can set up complex category structures and scoring methods. Under the [Here be dragons] option, the [Reset Rally] facility provides options to start from scratch or reload the demo. Please report to Bob anything that doesn't work, anything you don't like, anything that could be better. If you do like it and it does work, you could mention that also.
