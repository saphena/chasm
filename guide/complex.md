# ScoreMaster 4 - Complex scoring

Complex methods involve from one to nine sets of categories which are specified for each bonus or combo. Common sets are *Country*, *County*, *Industry*, *Building type*, etc.  For example, an ordinary bonus *F01* might specify *Country*=France, *Industry*=Cycling, *Building*=Shed.

In general, the idea is to generate a score using groups of bonuses rather than individual bonuses. Typically, the first relevant bonus is unaffected by the complex method but two or more will be.

Complex methods can be applied at three levels:- those which affect the individual bonus scores; those which reward sequences of bonuses collected; those which reward or punish collections of bonuses. Methods at each level can be combined both with the basic bonus scores and other levels.

## Individual bonus scores
Basic bonus scores can be modified by either the number of bonuses scored within a category (*Country* = *France* for example) or the number of categories having at least one bonus scored within a set (number of counties visited within a country).

The classic example of this method is the 2017 Brit Butt Rally in which the value of any bonus depended on the number of bonuses scored within a county. The first bonus was worth one point, the second two points, the third four points, the fourth eight points and so on.

Relatively complex arithmetic can be used in this method. Speak to Bob if you want to know more.

## Sequences
**Uninterrupted** claiming of a particular category can be used to award extra points. For example, three consecutive farms results in doubling the points awarded for the farm bonuses. The extra points can be either a multiple of the sum of the points scored by the relevant bonuses or a fixed number of extra points. The "uninterrupted" refers to the order of bonus claiming, not the proximity of bonuses within a group. eg. An entrant claims M3, M1, F1, M2: this gives an uninterrupted sequence (US) of two 'M's, not three. Claiming M5, M1, M3, F2 gives a US of three Ms.

## Collection of bonuses
This can be used to award extra points based on the number of bonuses scored within a category or the number of categories scored within a set. The criterion at this stage is simple group membership, order of scoring, etc are not relevant.

This method may also be used to force DNF in the event of too many/not enough categories being scored. DNF can also be forced if the ratio of bonuses scored in two categories differs from a specified ratio.

This mechanism can also be adapted to exclude certain bonuses rather than forcing DNF.
