# ScoreMaster 4 - Penalties

Several conditions can be easily penalised by the system. Additionally, arbitrary penalties can be imposed by making use of an extra bonus code. eg. 'ODDSOCKS' = -100 points, 'POLITEVEST' = -100000 points.

## Compulsory bonuses
Any bonus or combo can be flagged as being compulsory. Failure to score a compulsory bonus results in DNF.

## Minimum points
It is possible to specify a minimum number of points below which entrants would be DNF.

## Percentage points deduction
This is typically used to punish sloppy bonus claims, 10% being the usual figure. The percentage used is defined for the rally as a whole rather than for individual bonuses. Only one such provision can be defined.

## Distance penalties
Distance travelled can be used to penalise entrants. Two hard limits, not far enough and too far, can be used as DNF triggers. It is also possible to apply a points penalty for travelling too far as either a fixed number of points (> 250 miles = -500 points), a number of points per mile/kilometre.

Each rally has an official unit of distance, either miles or kilometres. Individual odometers will read either miles or kilometres and be converted by the system, if necessary, to the rally unit.  "Points per mile" will actually be points per kilometre in kilometre rallies.

## Time penalties
Each rally runs from the official start time to the official finish time. To allow for staggered starts, that timespan can be longer than the permitted number of hours. (eg. 8 hour rally runs from 0800 to 1800). An entrant finishing after his 8 hours or later than the official finish time is DNF.

Within the rally time window it's possible to impose points penalties, perhaps to encourage early check-in, either as a fixed number of points or as points per minute. Several such windows can be specified with different points values, they need not be confined to the end of the rally.
